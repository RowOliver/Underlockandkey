# Underlockandkey
In this project I was asked to make a workable password generator for the employees of a company. 


Tasks:
I was given starter code that needed to modified in order to fit the following criteria:
	- The length of the password needed to fall within 8 and 128 characters
	- The type of characters that it will allow:
		-Uppercase
		- Lowercase
		- Numbers
		- Special Characters 
	- The user has the ability to use some or all of the options given to them but at least one 	must be chosen. 


Project:
Link to Github repo


For this project, I created a function that calls the button when the user clicks on it. 

The possible contents of the password are in seperate variables

Then I created a loop to allow the data to be collected
